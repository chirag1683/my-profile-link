# my-profile-link
This is a beautiful and responsive Social ID website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a personal profile hub where users can list and link to their social media accounts â€” like a mini portfolio or digital business card.

As a Web Developer, I created this project to showcase clean UI design, responsiveness, and interactivity using only front-end web technologies.
