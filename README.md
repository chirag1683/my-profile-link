# my-profile-link
This is a simple and elegant Social ID website built using pure HTML and CSS. The purpose of this website is to serve as a personal profile or link hub, similar to Linktree, where users can showcase their social media links, GitHub profile, and other web identities in one place.

As a Web Developer, I created this project to demonstrate basic front-end development skills, clean UI design, and responsive layout using only HTML and CSS â€” without any frameworks or JavaScript.
